Working on Deepfake Detection using deep learning

We will try using Ensemble method to implement a better solution for this heavy crisis and try to make our research satisfactory.

Report and power presentation are added.

The initial stage in applying deepfake detection using an ensemble approach in deep learning is to gather a diverse dataset of real and fake movies. Frame extraction and augmentation techniques are used to preprocess the data. Use this dataset to train different deep learning models (such transformers, CNNs, and RNNs), each with a different architecture or emphasis on features. Using techniques like stacking, majority voting, or weighted averaging, combine their predictions to form the ensemble after they have been trained. Evaluate and modify the ensemble model in terms of precision, accuracy, and recall. Research papers, GitHub repositories, and online courses are a few more resources that offer more direction.
This projects aims in detection of video deepfakes using deep learning techniques like ResNext and LSTM. We have achived deepfake detection by using transfer learning where the pretrained ResNext CNN is used to obtain a feature vector, further the LSTM layer is trained using the features
